  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So I’m test riding a route on my bicycle with the intention of taking a group of friends on it the following weekend. This course would be ideal because it has a mid-point of one of the ‘Cadence Clubhouses’. Cadence Clubhouses are the cycle cafes in shipping containers scattered around the South Downs. You’ll see a congregation of Rapha-clad, lycra heads there with strings of mozzarella hanging from their mud-laden chin to their toastie.</p>

<p>The weekend before this I’d led some friends on a ride and was excited to take them out again, so I was testing the route for them. I shouldn’t have been so optimistic as I later found out that they each kept pretending to need a wee so that they could stop for a breather. The thing is if they cycled a bit faster they could have taken that breath in my slipstream!</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m following the course I’d set on my Garmin and naturally I’m zoning in and out. It could be the repetitive motion of cycling, the at-times monotonous landscape or a general tendency to lose focus that often leads my mind to wander when I’m on my bike. In this particular moment let’s say I was imagining spear-heading a tight peloton and whooshing past a wide-eyed child, making them spin on the spot and changing the course of their life forever.</p>

<p>I zone back in and my pesky Garmin has taken me on a dual carriageway again and it’s quite hairy. There’s barely 20cm between the mountainous cateyes and a steep muddy verge to my left. Traffic is rinsing past my right at 60mph and giving me no space as if making a point to scare me. No semblance of a bike lane, my Garmin is telling me there’s one more mile of this highway-to-hell so I up the gears and start to pound it.</p>

<p>Ahead of me I see a squirrel hopping onto the verge, likely after a delicious acorn or discarded McDonald’s straw. As I hurtle towards him at full speed, he is surprised. He has only a split second to decide whether to withdraw to the bushes or take the wild ride across the high-traffic blur. He makes his choice and leaps for the tarmac, but because I’m going so fast, and because I was already so close, he actually leaps into me.</p>

<p>First he hit my quickly pedaling foot, and like an accidental game of keepie-uppies I boot him to my front wheel which in turn whips him to my front fork. The tire is gripping him but he doesn’t fit through the fork so he’s just a pinball between pedal / wheel / fork over and over again. Neither of us can believe what’s happening until it’s been happening for several rotations. He’s screaming, I’m screaming. I’ve pulled my knees up to my chin but the pedals continue to whiz and whip him round and round. Four by fours continue to blitz past us on our right, one after the other, witness to our frenzy.</p>

<p>I feel his furry little body brush against my leg as he completes his ferris wheel of terror and gets launched back into the bushes as if I’ve just flicked an elastic band. Finally the mile is up and I turn off the road and dismount.</p>

<p>In this moment I am brimming with adrenaline and feel like I could lift a car. Where is that poor thing, let me lift a car off of him to make up for what just happened between us.</p>

<p>I feel guilt, was that a murder? Manslaughter maybe. Squirrel-slaughter.</p>

<p>I arrive at Cadence and confess to the two behind the counter my crime, but they both hate squirrels and congratulate me. They give me my iced americano for free and I sit on one of their plastic garden chairs and stare at the gravel. I’m not thirsty anymore but I don’t want to be rude so I solemnly sip my drink, expecting to hear the approaching sirens of the RSPCA. I know that my hands are freezing but I am numb to the pain, my guilty conscience enveloping my senses.</p>

<p>I try to carry on with my ride, but each roadkill hisses “for shame” at me as I amble by. Flies dive bomb into my eyeballs after every corner and I have to keep stopping to fish them out. I can feel the creatures of the surrounding forest watching me and I decide to catch a train home; nature knows what I did and I’m not welcome there today.</p>

<p>In the evening I have a first date and reveal my sin when she asks about my day. Instead of retribution it goes down a storm; “look I’m sporty and can alpha the natural world”. She laps up the story like it’s a comedy bit and the date is a major success. I just want to have to face some kind of consequence for what I did to that tiny squirrel.</p>

<p>On our second date she gives me a laminated certificate telling me a red squirrel has been adopted in my name, and it makes me feel a little bit better.</p>
