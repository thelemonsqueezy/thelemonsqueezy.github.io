With popcorn coursing through her veins, Eloise exhausted those around her with ramblings about the films she consumed. Even her pivot to literature provoked the regular whalesong of those feigning interest. “I haven’t read that actually” and “I don’t really like the cinema”, each an ignored blow to her blind enthusiasm.  

Her exasperated loved ones gathered together and wept, planting the smallest pip in their dampened soil hoping a miracle might grow. And oh how it grew; the most bountiful and bursting lemon tree erupted out of the earth overnight, bearing the sweetest fruit they had ever tasted. People would bite into them like apples, eyes rolling to the back of their heads, clambering to stop the citrus nectar dripping off of their chins, lest they waste a delicious pulpy drop.   

Inexplicably, each fruit bestowed the capacity to not only endure but _relish_ Eloise’s endless musings. And, much like statued cherubs in a manor garden, everyone shot the lemon juice out of their mouths in glorious arcs at the foot of the tree as they danced around it and listened to her speak. 

And that’s the story of Lemon Squeezy.

So light your citronella torches and swan-dive with me through the complexities of film and literature review as if it were the easiest and breeziest of slip ‘n’ slides. We’ll drizzle a little zest and zing, straight from the Jif-bottle-teat of my mind. 

Sit back, rinse your hands in a warm bowl of lemon-scented water and beware the wasps,   
<br />Eloisey Lemon Squeezy
