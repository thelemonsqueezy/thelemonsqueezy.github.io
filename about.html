    <p>Positively vibrating with enthusiasm, Eloise exhausted those around her with her ramblings. Even her wide breadth of topics provoked the regular whalesong of those feigning interest. “I don’t remember asking, actually” and “I’m expecting a phone call so make it quick”, each an ignored blow to her blind charisma.</p>

<p>Her exasperated loved ones gathered together and wept, planting the smallest pip in their dampened soil hoping a miracle might grow. And oh how it grew; the most bountiful and bursting lemon tree erupted out of the earth overnight, bearing the sweetest fruit they had ever tasted. People would bite into them like apples, eyes rolling to the back of their heads, clambering to stop the citrus nectar dripping off of their chins, lest they waste a delicious pulpy drop.</p>

<p>Inexplicably, each fruit bestowed the capacity to not only endure but relish Eloise’s endless musings. And, much like statued cherubs in a manor garden, everyone shot the lemon juice out of their mouths in glorious arcs at the foot of the tree as they danced around it and listened to her speak.</p>

<p>Word spread and like wasps to a sticky gloop of lemon curd, a global pilgrimage ensued. Swarms of hopefuls would erupt over the hills, careening down toward the powerful little lemon tree. Rinds would be sucked smooth, peel-scraps became the focus of fatal wrestling matches, sesame-seed sized zest would be savoured for days. And still the tree delivered more bounty, and Eloise more stories, as if vowing to feed the entire world itself.</p>

<p>Or so says the legend of The Lemon Squeezy.</p>

<p>So follow the citronella torches, swan-dive with me through the sherbert haze of my thoughts, and chug the complexities straight from the Jif-bottle-teat of my mind. We’ll drizzle a little zing to make the easiest and breeziest of slip ‘n’ slides, with a warm lemon-scented plunge pool to rinse you off.</p>

<p><br />Pucker up,</p>

<p><br />Eloisey Lemon Squeezy</p>
