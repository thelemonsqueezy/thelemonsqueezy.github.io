Edgar Wright’s _Last Night in Soho_ reads like someone gave an enormous budget to a GCSE Media student. With this in mind perhaps it would have been more exciting to watch it in a mobile classroom, because at least then you’d have the thrill of worrying you might get pantsed. 


The film follows 60s-nuts Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie), a wannabe fashion designer haunted by her mother’s ghost. She’s sweet, talented and seamlessly pulls off the British accent identical to mine when I pretend to be Oliver Twist. In a budding development on her already flimsy mental health (see: haunted by mother’s ghost), she finds that she’s able to access the glitz and glamour of 1960s London in her dreams vicariously through club singer Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), but as those dreams begin to bleed into her daily life Sandie’s boyfriend-come-trafficker (Matt Smith) propels a more sinister story. 


I like to imagine though that in his pitches for funding, Wright said something like, “yeah that’s the “plot”, sure, but _Last Night_ is really about watching a girl wave an enormous red flag; a top-of-the-barricade, do-you-hear-the-people-sing-sized red flag, and everyone just humours her”. 


Wright’s editing and insane budget has become no more than a kitsch distraction to his senseless story. Due to his focus on the overplayed perils of toxic masculinity and the horrors of sex trafficking, devoid of all nuance and subtlety, Wright misses the opportunity to gear his recent style-over-substance shift toward comedy, which might have provided the only framework to absorb the narrative potholes. 


In a cute flip on the “it was all a dream” trope, we find out in the last minutes of the film that it was all actually _not_ just a mental health crisis, yet that doesn’t help the fact that a real reaction to Eloise’s troubling behaviour would be significantly less nonchalant, and significantly more section-y. Or at least a bit more, call-her-gran-y. 


Get yourself a man who can both thwart your attempts to kill and be stabbed in your burning-down house and still want to get with you. 


And John (Michael Ajao) is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to characters navigating the plot in the most inconceivable ways. As one example, if your employee was hours late to work, wearing halloween makeup from two days ago and was inexplicably soaking wet, then smashed a pint on the floor before chasing a customer into the road where he was hit by a car, wouldn’t you find this at least _slightly_ odd?


It is sweet relief when we see that Eloise is back to seeing just the original ghosts of the past in the mirror, even if only because it meant I’d made it to the end of the film.
