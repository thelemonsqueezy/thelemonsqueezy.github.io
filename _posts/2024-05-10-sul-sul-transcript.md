I was sure there was a ladder when I jumped in, she thought, as she started comparing the tiled walls towering above her to flat shiny everests. She’s been slowly realising what a silly pastime submerging yourself in a liquid really is, when it is a foreign and unsurvivable landscape to most four-legged creatures. If she had managed to climb out after a few minutes this thought would have been quickly forgotten and she’d be cannon-balling back in the pool tomorrow evening for her daily laps, but she’s been treading water for 3 hours now. She notices a beetle on its back careening past her on a wave from her thrashing body, and realises that her and that turtling little pest are in the same, unfortunately metaphorical, boat. 


Like everyone else she moved here, with her wife, when the city was hit by a monster attack that triggered the worst nuclear disaster since the tornado blitz the week before. When they arrived at the run-down bungalow in this strange town, they spent endless nights dancing together in the kitchen to samba records. They made friends with the neighbours and the maid and the boy who delivers the newspapers and got slacker jobs to pay their bills. The fruits of motherlode never reached this dusty old bungalow but they were truly happy; though their lives had been destroyed they still had each other. 


But when the sofa caught fire and the record player got stolen by a mime in the night it felt like the reality of their new town was catching up on them. Pleasantville was suddenly a lifetime ago. She could see in her wife’s eyes when they lay upon her the pain of being reminded of a time that was lost. Her wife thought it would be better to forget what was gone and to accept what they’ve got now, but how could she ever forget all that happiness? 


As her body grows weak her legs start to feel like anchors dropped at the deep end pulling her down. She’s so hungry she can picture the enormous bowl of cereal she made for her and her wife this morning, droplets of condensation running down the side of the ceramic as it remains untouched on the kitchen counter. The panic overloads her mind with thoughts of a shower, a bed, a conversation, the cereal; flicking past each dangerously-low basic need like a spinning merry-go-round, kind of like the spin when you change from outfit to outfit she thought momentarily before returning to her desperation. 


As they drifted apart, it felt like her wife was quickly shedding all aspects of their old life. She was spending her time building those new relationships and growing skills for her career, she said, by talking endlessly into the mirror for hours after hours. She just missed when she used to talk to her; she can’t even remember the last time she got the Mary Mac, goose, woohoo treatment. These days she just hears her wife giggling and scuffling around upstairs with the cleaner, who by the way clocks out and the beds aren’t even made. And why is the hot tub always bubbling, she thinks.


She must be hallucinating now because from the pool she sees fireworks go off in their bedroom upstairs. The room goes dark and the only light is the azure glow from the pool and the faint moonlight across the plains. She sees that wretched stray dog root through their bins and she cries desperately for help. It looks up at her for a moment, startled, but after realising she can’t shoo it away continues its rummaging. Her arms are starting to fill with acid and she can feel it whoosh around her body with each movement. She tries to save energy by floating on her back as still as possible, maybe she can hold out until the newspaper delivery boy comes by in the morning. Then she remembers that the newspaper delivery boy stopped coming because they kept letting their newspapers go mouldy in the front garden, arguably a job for a maid she always thought. 


There isn’t any grass in this town, it’s just dry earth. Some mornings she thinks she can see perfectly manicured emerald green lawns in the distance, with razor sharp right angled edges. It must just be a mirage, because really nothing grows here. In their old garden they had a small lake with a weeping willow and lily pads, and a bench swing that they would sit on together. They had sprinklers and chrysanthemums, and bumble bees and peonies. The only thing that grows in StrangeTown is the green cloud of flies around last night’s dinner that her wife didn’t eat and the maid didn’t clean. 


If she was back in her old life someone would have noticed that she’s been gone by now. She’s starting to let go, she can feel the tug of a warm memory beckoning her. Maybe she’ll see her wife looking at her lovingly from their seat under the willow. The sting of the chlorine in her eyes pushes warm tears out, and it’s actually nice. Like when you go to sleep after you’ve been crying. Her vision blurs and she starts to gulp it all down. As the water swallows her whole she sees that fateful hooded figure looming above and she hopes she’s going home.
